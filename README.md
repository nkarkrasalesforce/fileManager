## Permissions and Security

- The component uses Salesforce's sharing rules and user permissions
- File actions are subject to the user's access level
- Apex methods include security checks to prevent unauthorized operations

## Limitations

- Maximum file upload size depends on Salesforce's standard limits
- Supported in Lightning Experience and Community Pages
- Requires appropriate object and file sharing permissions

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the `FileManagerController` has the necessary sharing and visibility settings
- Check that static resources and Apex classes are properly deployed
- Verify user permissions for file-related operations
